**UIDAI Data Hackathon | Team ID: UIDAI_5246**

## 📌Project Overview
This project analyzes Aadhaar enrolment, demographic updates, and biometric updates data to derive actionable insights for data-driven policy planning and governance.

The analysis focuses on state-wise distribution, demographic patterns, and temporal trends using aggregated and anonymized UIDAI open data.

## 🎯Objectives
- Analyze state-wise Aadhaar enrolment patterns
- Study age-group and demographic update distributions
- Identify temporal and seasonal trends
- Highlight regional disparities
- Support evidence-based policy decisions

## Dataset Details
